# Hi, I'm Muja.

I build professional-grade tools for developers — fast, focused and powered by AI when it helps.

### Projects I'm Proud Of

-  [`brewgen`](https://github.com/mujasoft/brewgen): AI-powered Homebrew formula generator — takes your repo and builds a polished `.rb` file
-  [`jenkins_ai_log_analyser`](https://github.com/mujasoft/jenkins_ai_log_analyser): Uses LLMs to extract signal from noisy Jenkins pipelines
-  [`git_log_analyser`](https://github.com/mujasoft/git_log_analyser): Embeds your git commits and lets you ask questions like: _"What changed in the last 10 releases?"_

###  What I Do
- Automate developer pain away with Python + Bash + LLMs
- Build CI/CD insights tools with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and custom log pipelines
- Simulate embedded environments (RTOS, memory pool allocators, etc.)

### Tools I Love
`Python` · `Typer` · `Rich` · `Dynaconf` · `GitPython` · `Ollama` · `Terraform` · `FFmpeg` · `Jenkins`



Always building. Always shipping.
